                <h2>Our Approach</h2>
                <p>Our deep understanding of the key biological underpinnings of cancer and ability to identify, interrogate, and successfully drug intracellular enzyme targets enables us to advance a pipeline of unique small molecule therapeutics with expansive potential. Building upon industry-leading expertise in RNA-modifying proteins (RMPs) and our systematic mapping of both the RMP space and adjacent high-value areas for drug discovery, we’re building a flexible model that allows for a diversity of approaches to developing potentially transformative biomarker-driven cancer medicines. Our therapies are designed for both novel and known, but suboptimally-addressed, high-impact oncogenic targets with the potential to benefit large patient populations with significant unmet need.</p>

            <h2>Platform & Capabilities</h2>
            <p>Accent's platform and integrated capabilities fuel a robust pipeline of transformative small molecule oncology therapeutics with expansive potential for individuals living with difficult-to-treat cancers. We’re combining cutting-edge approaches to identify and prioritize the most critical targets for biomarker-driven oncology indications, and to efficiently match those targets with novel small molecule inhibitors that serve as powerful starting points for our drug optimization efforts.</p>

                            <p>Accent's lead program is a first-in-class DHX9 inhibitor with the potential to address high unmet need indications that lack targeted therapies, including colorectal, endometrial, gastric, and other high microsatellite instable (MSI-H) cancers, and numerous undisclosed additional cancer types representing large patient populations. DHX9 is an RNA helicase that has been reported to play important roles in replication, transcription, translation, RNA splicing, RNA processing, and maintenance of genomic stability. Overexpression of DHX9 is observed in multiple cancer types making this helicase a compelling novel oncology target. Inhibition of DHX9 exploits a key vulnerability of cancers to induce cancer cell death while sparing normal cells.</p>
                            <p> Accent's pursuit of this novel target is enabled by a proprietary crystal structure and suite of bespoke assays developed in-house to support high-throughput screening efforts for efficient drug discovery efforts. </p>
                            <p>This program is advancing rapidly, and IND-enabling studies have been initiated. We are also exploring the sensitivity of other tumor types to DHX9 inhibition as part of our work to uncover the full scope of DHX9's potential and bring this treatment to as many patients as possible.</p>
